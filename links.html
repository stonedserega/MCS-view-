    <h2 id="carear">Early career</h2>
    <p>Though Banksy's identity was well guarded, he came to notice as a freehand graffiti artist in 1993.<br/> 
Using stencils since 2000 to enhance his speed, he developed a distinctive iconography of highly recognizable images, such as rats and policemen, that communicated his antiauthoritarian message. With wry wit and stealth, Banksy merged graffiti art with installation and performance.<br/>In the 2003 exhibition “Turf War,” he painted on the bodies of live pigs.
 At his “Crude Oils” exhibition in London in 2005, which featured altered replicas of the works of Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, and Edward Hopper, he released 200 live rats in the gallery.<br/>
    In 2005 Banksy, fully disguised, installed his own works on the walls of major museums in New York City and London, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Tate Britain.</p>

    <p>Banksy's books—which included Banging Your Head Against a Brick Wall (2001), Existencilism (2002), and Wall and Piece (2005)—documented his projects; iconic examples of his work, including a life-size image of two policemen kissing, were featured in the bleak futuristic film Children of Men (2006).<br/>
     Banksy directed the 2010 film Exit Through the Gift Shop, a documentary that ostensibly profiled the lives and work of the worlds most talented graffiti artists. Critics were divided on the film, though, as some chose to accept it at face value while others saw it as a satire, with documentary subject and filmmaker-turned-street artist Thierry Guetta (who, some theorized, was an actor paid by Banksy or was, perhaps, Banksy himself) serving as a commentator on the commercialization of art.</p>
    <h2 id="auction">Banksy at auction</h2>

    <p>In late 2018 Girl with Balloon (2006), a canvas version of one of Banksy’s most popular murals, startled onlookers at an auction when the work seemingly self-destructed by partly shredding just after selling for $1.4 million. As speculation about the meaning of the stunt and about the involvement of the auction house erupted on social media, Banksy posted a video claiming credit for the prank. He later released another video suggesting that the shredder, hidden in the frame, was meant to destroy the work completely but had malfunctioned.<br/>
     Pest Control, Banksy's authentication bureau, also issued a certificate acknowledging that the destroyed work had become a new piece of art with a new name, Love Is in the Bin. The work sold in 2021 for $25 million, beating Banksy’s previous auction record, which had been set by Game Changer in 2020, when it sold for $22 million.</p>
